# Netflix-React
Greetings and welcome to my Netflix React App. The purpose of this project is purely educational. The syntax I use are methods I have learned from my fabulous mentor and through other wonderful sources I have come across on the Internet. 

The current tools I am using is: React, a movie DB API which can be found here: https://www.themoviedb.org/, and CSS. This is an ever evolving app and is suspectible to constant changes and updates. 

Thank you for reading.
